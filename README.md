<br>


**thawani_payment** using the official [webview_flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/webview_flutter).
<br>
<br>
### ‚ö†Ô∏è The Requirement ‚ö†Ô∏è :

|             | Android | iOS    |
| ----------- | ------- | ------ | 
| **Support** | 	SDK 19+ or 20+ | iOS 9+ 




## Setup:

Pubspec changes:

```
      dependencies:
        thawani_payment: ^0.0.1
```
Sample example:

```dart
import 'package:thawani_payment/thawani_payment.dart';

ThawaniPayBtn(
  api: 'API Key',
          pKey: 'Publishable Key',
          clintID: 'String',
          onError: (e){},
          products:[],
          onCreate: (v) {},
          onCancelled: (v){},
          onPaid: (v){}, 
          );
```

## Getting Started

- The official  API Document From Thawani in <https://docs.thawani.om/>.

- **First You Should have Keys From Thawani**  [Thawani Checkout](https://thawani.om/checkout/)

- And ensure to enable billing for the project.

### Android

1. You should however make sure to set the correct `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` if it was previously lower than 19:




```groovy
android {
    defaultConfig {
        minSdkVersion 19
    }
}
```


### Note

- **This package will update if there any update in Thawani checkout**
- Your use of the package is your personal choice. The developer of the package has nothing to do with errors that may occur with you during payment.
- I recommend using the test mode to ensure that the package is free of errors before uploading it to users.


See the `example` directory for a complete sample app.
